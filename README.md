# g2a.scrapper

I use an external sh script to make the query to the website. I do this because I developed the scraper in bash. Furthermore, I am not completely sure if scrapping frameworks in kotlin can mimic a browser request as curl can do.
That is to be developed. The query using the same Skrape.it framework I am using. G2A blocks connections that detect that are non browser, which makes it harder to make a scrapper using the some frameworks.
